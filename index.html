    <p> New York City is a travel destination for many every single year. Whether it be food, site seeing, or catching some broadway shows, the city sees thousands of travelers in any given month. But an unfamiliar adventure can be explored by simply walking down the street. </p>
    <p> A cultural hub like NYC is bound to have unique trends and ways of living, but one phenomenon is the rare treasures you can find within someone else's trash. Need a new couch? Take a gander down your street. Need a new bookcase, or maybe a reading lamp? Go shopping on someone’s front stoop.  </p>
    <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has brought stooping to a whole new level, with many people leaving the city in the past year, there has been more to stoop. Across all five boroughs you can find a treasure trove of items. </p>
    <p> The Instagram account “stoopingnyc” is run by a couple based in Brooklyn, who wish to remain anonymous. They said before the pandemic the account only had about 40,000 followers. Now, it has over 150,000. </p>

    <p>“We actually pressed pause on the account for about three months because we felt kind of irresponsible sending people out on the street when everyone was supposed to be home,” they said. “We came back online in early summer and that’s when you absolutely saw the effects of people leaving the city. There were like full apartment stoops on the streets in the summer.”</p>
    <p>Each day they receive thousands and thousands of admissions sent in from all over the city. With so many to choose from, they have learned to post the best goodies that are bound to get snatched up quick.</p>
    <p>“We have been doing it long enough now that we kind of have an understanding of like, what the community really loves,” they said. “So I mean, obviously anything that's high value, or that looks like it's pretty valuable, but they also really love things that are weird and quirky.”</p>

    <p>Yesenia Jimenez, 28, lives in Queens. Before finding work at a dental office, she was laid off and had to move, making buying furniture an expensive priority. She was able to use the stooping instagram pages to help with the burden.</p>
    <p>“My favorite stoop was my son’s desk and chair,” she said. “He is doing school fully remote and is only ten. So it was perfect for him.” </p>
    <p>This special cultural aspect of NYC is something that many don’t realize is as vibrant as it is, but many homes are being furnished with treasure finds. It adds a touch of uniqueness to anyone's space because there is a story that goes along with every find. </p>
    <p>Emily Finch, a 21-year-old senior at Hunter College moved to Manhattan in September. Finch grew up about two hours outside of the city and didn’t really know much about the stooping culture in NYC. She said the pandemic really caused a rise in what people were willing to give up for free.</p>
    <p>“You know, another man’s trash is another man’s treasure,” Finch said. “There has always been an element of it, but never, never as good as I’ve seen it now.”</p>
    <p>Finch and her roommates were on the hunt for a good couch since their floppy, uncomfortable futon wasn’t doing much for the living room setting anymore. As Finch was sitting in her room one day, her roommate knocked on the door wanting to show her a gorgeous pink futon just two blocks away from their apartment in the East Village. </p>

  <p>“We threw on shoes and ran to check it out,” she said. “We were like ‘yeah, this is incredible.’ We carried it up five flights of stairs, cleaned it, and it has been the biggest blessing.”</p>
  <p>The lucky find has brought comfortability back to their apartment, which is something they had missed due to their last couch causing “your butt to feel like it’s gonna fall off after a minute.” </p>
  <p>Charles Manning, 37, has lived all over New York for the last 15 years. He’s gone as far as 12 blocks away to score something he found on the stooping Instagram pages. Stooping has helped him spend less on new things and more on used items. </p>
  <p>“I'm really concerned with trying to live sustainably and I buy everything I possibly can secondhand,” he said. “I saw a bunch of stuff on the outside of a townhouse here on the Upper East Side. There's all this great stuff. I can't believe people just throw it on the street.” </p>
  <p>Stooping in NYC has given many people the opportunity to furnish their homes without having to spend a dollar. Rather than dealing with the hassle of selling something online, giving away something for free has become an exciting blessing for many as you can see on pages like “stoopingnyc.” Some of the most popular posts on the Instagram account are the before and after treasure finds.</p>
  <p>“I think it’s just really cool for humans to be like this isn’t serving me right now and I’m sure someone else could make use of it and needs it especially at a time right now when there’s been so much loss,” Finch said. </p>
