    <p> New York City is a travel destination for many every single year. Whether it be food, site seeing, or catching some broadway shows, the city sees thousands of travelers in any given month. But an unfamiliar adventure can be explored by simply walking down the street. </p>
    <p> A cultural hub like NYC is bound to have unique trends and ways of living, but one phenomenon is the rare treasures you can find within someone else's trash. Need a new couch? Take a gander down your street. Need a new bookcase, or maybe a reading lamp? Go shopping on someone’s front stoop.  </p>
    <p> The COVID-19 pandemic has brought stooping to a whole new level, with many people leaving the city in the past year, there has been more to stoop. Across all five boroughs you can find a treasure trove of items. </p>
    <p> The Instagram account “stoopingnyc” is run by a couple based in Brooklyn, who wish to remain anonymous. They said before the pandemic the account only had about 40,000 followers. Now, it has over 150,000. </p>
